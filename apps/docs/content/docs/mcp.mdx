description: Expose next-lens data to IDEs or copilots via MCP.
---

Run `next-lens mcp` to start a Model Context Protocol server that exposes the
same route insights to supporting tools.

## Configure a client

Add a server entry to your MCP client (example JSON):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "next-lens": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["next-lens@latest", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available tools

- `api-list` — list API routes; accepts `targetDirectory` and `method`.
- `page-list` — list page routes; accepts `targetDirectory`.
- `api-search` — filter API routes by `search` plus optional `method`.
- `page-search` — filter page routes by `search`.

Each tool uses the same validation as the CLI (e.g., HTTP method checking) and
returns JSON payloads ready for client-side rendering or further filtering.
