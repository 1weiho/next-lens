Get the CLI running in a Next.js App Router project and map routes fast.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommend matching your Next.js project requirement).
- Access to the project directory you want to scan.

## Run the CLI

Launch the inspector UI

```npm
npx next-lens@latest web
```

List pages directly from the CLI

```npm
npx next-lens@latest page:list
```

Or filter API handlers by method

```npm
npx next-lens@latest api:list --method GET
```

Collect stack details

```npm
npx next-lens@latest info
```

## Monorepo or alternate targets

All commands accept an optional `[target-directory]` (defaults to `.`):

```npm
npx next-lens@latest page:list ./apps/web
```

```npm
npx next-lens@latest api:list ../other-project --method POST
```

The CLI scans the provided directory without needing to run the Next.js
development server.
