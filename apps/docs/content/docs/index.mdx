---

`next-lens` is a lightweight CLI for the Next.js App Router. It scans any
project directory, no Next.js runtime needed, and surfaces routes and stack
details in seconds.

## Highlights

- List `app/api/**/route.*` with detected HTTP handlers.
- List `app/**/page.*` with loading/error fallback coverage.
- Colorized dynamic/optional/catch-all params for quick visual parsing.
- Works on any target directory; defaults to the current working dir.
- Launch a web inspector UI (`next-lens web`) for a visual view.
- MCP server mode to expose the same tools to IDEs/copilots.
