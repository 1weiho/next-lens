`next-lens web` runs a local server that visualizes App Router pages and API
routes in a browser.

## Features

- Search and filter routes across your project.
- Add or remove HTTP methods on an API route.
- Open a route's source file directly in your IDE.

## Start the inspector

```npm
npx next-lens web [target-directory]
```

- Defaults to the current directory.
- Opens `http://localhost:9453` by default (pass `--no-open` to skip).

## Options

- `-p, --port <port>` — server port (default `9453`).
- `--no-open` — do not auto-open the browser.
