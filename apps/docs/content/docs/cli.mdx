All commands default to the current working directory. Pass an optional
`[target-directory]` to point at another project.

- `page:list [dir]` — list App Router pages with loading/error coverage.
- `api:list [dir] [-m, --method <METHOD>]` — list API handlers with HTTP
  method detection.
- `info [dir]` — show framework/runtime/package-manager snapshot.
- `about` — print a one-page tool overview.
- `web [dir]` — launch the inspector UI (see Inspector page).
- `mcp` — start the MCP server for copilots/IDEs.

## page:list

```bash
next-lens page:list [target-directory]
```

- Shows `app/**/page.*` routes.
- Indicates loading/error fallbacks as co-located, inherited, or missing.
- Highlights dynamic, optional, and catch-all params.

## api:list

```bash
next-lens api:list [target-directory] --method GET
```

- Lists `app/api/**/route.*` handlers.
- `--method` filters by HTTP verb (case-insensitive). Invalid verbs exit with
  a helpful message.
- Displays dynamic segments with colorized params.

## info

```bash
next-lens info [target-directory]
```

- Reads `package.json` (if present) and node_modules to detect Next.js and
  React versions.
- Reports Node runtime version and package manager/lockfile.
- Works even when `package.json` is absent, with limited output.

## about

```bash
next-lens about
```

- Prints a concise overview of the tool and its purpose.
